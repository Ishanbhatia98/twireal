1. Can use declarative content api to apply permissions based on the page opened by the user.
2. Can use Native Messaging to actually evaluate a user as a bot or not.
3. Currently the extension, initializes only once when the page is visited, 
    it does not activate when the user is scrolling through his wall on the
    twitter page -  A mutation observer is being used for detecting scrolling - 
    when new content is detected in the DOM of the page, the script is rerun
4. Twitters HomeTimeLine API is fetched via service worker and not directly accessed on the page,
 this causes issues to interact with it in the extension code.
